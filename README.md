# Multilayered-Networks

Here you will find some code samples I have been using for the time-varying multilayered network analysis that I am running on a set of EEG and fMRI data I collected simultaneously on a linguistic paradigm. The codes are modality independent, so you can apply them to your network matrices after you construct them. You will get a guidiance for how the initial multilayered matrix should be structured like within each script. 

Some of the codes are dependent on set of network and connectivity toolboxes such as Brain Connectivity Toolbox by Sporns et al.(2010), multilayered community detection toolbox by Mucha et al.(2010) and multilayered network analysis toolbox by Basset et al.(2013). Therefore I would recommend you to download those tooloboxes and add to your Matlab path before you run the codes I upload here. 

Please do let me know if you encounter with any problems in running the code or find any bugs in the code or any error with the application of the methods or coding. I am open to any comments and recommendations.

Thank you for visiting by and sharing this journey with me.
